### @Transactional

Suppose you are building an e-commerce application that allows customers to purchase items from your online store. When a customer submits an order, you need to update the database to reflect the new order and deduct the items from your inventory.

You might have a method in your code that handles the order submission, like this

```java
public void submitOrder(Order order) {
    // Update the database with the new order
    orderRepository.save(order);
    
    // Deduct the items from inventory
    for (OrderItem item : order.getItems()) {
        inventoryService.deductItem(item.getItemId(), item.getQuantity());
    }
}
```
In this example, the submitOrder method updates the database with the new order and then deducts the items from the inventory. However, if an error occurs while deducting the items (for example, if the inventory is already empty), the database will have been updated with an order that was never completed.

To ensure that the order and inventory updates are performed atomically and that the database remains consistent, you can annotate the submitOrder method with @Transactional:

```java
@Transactional
public void submitOrder(Order order) {
    // Update the database with the new order
    orderRepository.save(order);
    
    // Deduct the items from inventory
    for (OrderItem item : order.getItems()) {
        inventoryService.deductItem(item.getItemId(), item.getQuantity());
    }
}
```

By annotating the method with @Transactional, the entire method will execute within a single transaction. If an error occurs while deducting the items, the entire transaction will be rolled back, ensuring that the order is not saved to the database and that the inventory remains unchanged.

In summary, @Transactional is used to ensure that a set of related operations are executed as a single, atomic unit of work, and to maintain data consistency and integrity in the face of errors and failures.
