## Design Pattern
A design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. It is a proven approach for solving a particular type of problem in a way that is both effective and efficient. Design patterns are not complete solutions themselves, but rather templates or blueprints for solving specific problems that can be adapted to different situations.

Design patterns can be applied at various levels of software design, including architecture, structure, and behavior. They are typically classified into three categories:

* Creational patterns: These patterns are used to create objects in a way that promotes flexibility, reusability, and maintainability. Examples of creational patterns include the Singleton pattern, Factory pattern, and Abstract Factory pattern.

* Structural patterns: These patterns are used to organize classes and objects into larger structures while keeping them flexible and efficient. Examples of structural patterns include the Adapter pattern, Bridge pattern, and Decorator pattern.

* Behavioral patterns: These patterns are used to manage interactions between objects and classes in a way that is both predictable and maintainable. Examples of behavioral patterns include the Observer pattern, Strategy pattern, and Command pattern.

Design patterns are a way for software developers to leverage the experience and knowledge of other developers to solve common problems in software design. By using design patterns, developers can reduce the likelihood of introducing bugs, improve code readability and maintainability, and increase the efficiency of their development process.


## Description

### Singleton pattern

The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This means that no matter how many times the Singleton class is instantiated, there will always be only one instance of that class in the entire system.

The Singleton pattern is commonly used in situations where it is necessary to have a single instance of a class that can be accessed from multiple points in the application, such as a configuration manager, a database manager, or a logging service.

To implement the Singleton pattern, the class must have a private constructor to prevent instantiation of the class from outside. Additionally, the class must have a static method that returns the single instance of the class. The first time the static method is called, it creates the single instance of the class, and subsequent calls return the same instance.

Here's an example of a Singleton class in Java:

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
        // Private constructor to prevent instantiation from outside
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if(instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

```

In this example, the Singleton class has a private constructor to prevent instantiation from outside. The class also has a static method, getInstance(), that creates the single instance of the class if it does not already exist, and returns that instance. Subsequent calls to getInstance() will return the same instance.
