## Design Pattern
A design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. It is a proven approach for solving a particular type of problem in a way that is both effective and efficient. Design patterns are not complete solutions themselves, but rather templates or blueprints for solving specific problems that can be adapted to different situations.

Design patterns can be applied at various levels of software design, including architecture, structure, and behavior. They are typically classified into three categories:

* Creational patterns: These patterns are used to create objects in a way that promotes flexibility, reusability, and maintainability. Examples of creational patterns include the Singleton pattern, Factory pattern, and Abstract Factory pattern.

* Structural patterns: These patterns are used to organize classes and objects into larger structures while keeping them flexible and efficient. Examples of structural patterns include the Adapter pattern, Bridge pattern, and Decorator pattern.

* Behavioral patterns: These patterns are used to manage interactions between objects and classes in a way that is both predictable and maintainable. Examples of behavioral patterns include the Observer pattern, Strategy pattern, and Command pattern.

Design patterns are a way for software developers to leverage the experience and knowledge of other developers to solve common problems in software design. By using design patterns, developers can reduce the likelihood of introducing bugs, improve code readability and maintainability, and increase the efficiency of their development process.
