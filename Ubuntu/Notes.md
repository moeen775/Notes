## What is sudo in ubuntu?

In Ubuntu (and other Linux distributions), "sudo" stands for "Superuser Do" and is used to execute a command with administrative or superuser privileges.

By default, Ubuntu creates a non-root user during the installation process and does not give that user full administrative access. The "sudo" command allows this user to execute commands with elevated privileges, which is necessary for tasks that require root or superuser access, such as installing software, modifying system files, or managing system services.

When you run a command with "sudo", you will be prompted to enter your user password to verify your identity and ensure that you have permission to execute the command. Once you have entered your password and the system verifies your identity, the command will be executed with elevated privileges.

It's important to use "sudo" carefully, as it can potentially cause damage to your system if used improperly. Make sure you understand what a command does before running it with "sudo", and avoid using "sudo" for commands that do not require administrative access.
